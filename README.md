### Project Title
<p>What Number am I Thinking of Between 1 and X? </p>

### Project Descripton
<p>Our web page is a number guessing game. The server starts by randomly choosing a number between 1 and X, and hides it from the user. It then asks the user how many attempts they want to guess the number (number of attempts must be less than X). The server then prompts the user to guess what the number between 1 and X is, and if the user guesses correctly, the server congratulates them, asks the user for their name, and adds their name to a winners list. If they guess wrong, they are prompted to keep guessing until they run out of tries. Once the user runs out of tries, the game ends. </p>

### Project Description - Edited After Zoom Meeting
<p>Our web page is a number guessing game. The server randomly chooses a number, x, that is between 1 and 100. There will be four modes: easy, medium, hard, and insane. Easy mode will give the user 25 guesses, medium will give 15, and hard will give 5. Insane mode is separate, with x between 1 and 1000 and the user only gets one guess. The server then prompts the user to guess what the number between 1 and X is, and if the user guesses correctly, the server congratulates them, asks the user for their name, and adds their name to a winners list. The user can choose to either enter their name, or skip that option. If they guess wrong, they are prompted to keep guessing until they run out of tries. Once the user runs out of tries, the game ends.</p>
<p>The leaderboard will be ordered by the easy, medium, and hard modes. It will list players with least amount of guesses taken as first place; if two players have the same amount of guesses, those players will each be listed in a separate line (so if there are three people that took one guess, have their names in first place, listed as personA, personB, personC, then if there are two people that took two guesses, have their names listed underneath in second place, etc.) </p>

### Side Feature
<p> Our side feature is a weather dashboard, which will display information about the clientâ€™s local weather. It will include temperature, cloudiness (sunny, partially cloudy, or cloudy), precipitation (rain, snow, etc.), and wind speed/direction. </p>
